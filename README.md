# 🌘 **Eclipse – AI-Powered Exploration Assistant**

**Eclipse** is a smart app designed to help you explore places on **LG Rigs** using simple **text or voice commands**. It gives you clear and detailed responses through interactive **KML balloons** and allows you to control the experience hands-free with **Galaxy Glider**, your built-in voice assistant.
